# Rarisma Server Manager, Server Hosting simplified.

Rarisma Server Manager (RSM) is a C# project that aims to make server hosting a one click solution thats easy enough for five year olds to use, whilst providing advanced customisation features for those who need to use it. All you should need to run a server is decently powered PC and five or so minutes.

These are ideals and have no eta, and may not even be possible so take them with a pinch of salt.
4.0 - Feature Parity with previous versions.
4.1 - Docker Support
4.x - Split project in a client and server solution so an RSM instance can be managed elsewhere. (example - Control PC hosted servers with a phone.)
4.x - Linux Support
4.x - Web UI
4.x - Take on Ptero/Wisp/other Hosting pannels.`

The Future - Host servers on devices such as Xbox Dev Mode, RPi, Android?


#### Who made RSM?
RSM itself is developed by Rarisma, however it would not be possible without the server hosting community.

#### What's the history of RSM?
RSM 1.0 was originally made in WPF and was called SSM (This was changed as Simple Server Manager was high in results.). It was originally made to just run minecraft servers, it then added support for Terraria.
RSM 2.0 was then made in Avalonia to add Linux support however it didn't work on Linux well, support for mindustry was added.
RSM 3.0 was made in WinUI3 (known as project Reunion at the time) however it was quite buggy, support for factorio was added.
RSM 4.0 is made in WinUI3 Unpackaged and is more stable and had a complete overhaul in how servers are made, managed and downloaded.
Between 3.0 and 4.0 I hosted my own server called Complex Warfare (Later known as SkylineMC, then RZMA Network.

4.0 is still experemental and has been hard to work on due to personal commitments and as such isn't ready for primetime, yet.
One day I will finish this project as my aim with 4.0 is to simply build the app to a point it can host a wide variety of servers
with very little to no maintainance as I do not like building projects that I will have to maintain forever.
