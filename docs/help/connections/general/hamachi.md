### How do I use Hamachi

  - Done!

### How do other people use this

### How people join my game 
Once they have joined the server, right click on your user name and click copy IPV4, this is the IP Adress that people will need to connect to your network. Don't worry this isnt your real IP and nobody who isn't your network can access your server or your computer.

### FAQ

##### Should I use hamachi

  If you don't feel confident editing router settings then yes, although hamachi isn't ideal it will get the job done in most cases
  
### WHat does relayed/blocked tunnel mean

  This means that Hamachi cannot connect you to that person, I would link a guide however I cannot find a solution that has worked for me, if you do please send it me so I can link it here. If this happens and you can't find a fix then you should look into port forwarding, luckily we have a guide for that
  
### Why hamachi groups limited to 5 people

  This is because you are using hamachi's free tier, to get around this limit you can simply create more networks as long as the hosting device is in this network. The other way around this restriction is port forwarding
