# Port forwarding

Port forwarding is an alternative to using hamachi and is only needed to be done by the host. This may be more complicated than using hamachi as it requires editing your router page. If you cannot access your router page or don't know your routers password then you cannot use this method


# How to guide
    - First log in to your router page, you can find the login information on the bottom or side of your router, you can get to the page by going to 192.168.0.1 in most case
    - Enter the router password if asked (Also on the bottom of your router)
    - STATIC IP ASSIGNMENT INFO
    - Look for a port forwarding option, this may need you to enable expert mode if your router has one or may be put under a tab like security
    - Add a new port and set it to the port shown in SSM and set it to hosting computers static IP
    - If it asks for what protocol then set it to the protocol shown in SSM
    - Set the end port to the information shown in SSM if asked for however some routers may not need this.
