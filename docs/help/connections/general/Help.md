# Hamachi or Port forwarding, which should I choose?
Port forwarding is considered to be the better option however it requires access to your router settings pannel, so if that sounds too complicated or you don't have access to it then hamachi is the way to go, otherwise you should defintely check out Port Forwarding first.

# Are there any risks to forwarding ports/using hamachi?
No. If you keep your security and antiviruses up to date then you should be safe
For Hamachi, only people you let join can access your network
For port forwarding, when you are finished hosting and don't intend to host the server then you should probably close the portfor extra security
