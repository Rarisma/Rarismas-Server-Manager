# RSM Progess Report 1
#### Writen by Rarisma (16/05/2021)

Recently we have made several major fixes, thanks to testers we have fixed opening folders, which are now created when installing server. It was also noticed that our solution to closing servers when RSM itself was closed, so for now we disable the ability to close RSM while a server is running however we should hopefully have a solution to this by the next progress report which will be seamless.

We also have released AutoMode which allows you to set up a server as quick as possible, this should help users who want to just get into the game quickly or those who want to test servers. As of now all servers support RSM however in the future when servers are added it may take awhile for them to support automode. A caveat of automode is the fact that RSM will make some assumptions such as the amount of RAM to allocate, world size ect. So if you are planning on making a server and playing on it then you may want to spend an extra few minutes configuring the server.

We also trying to fix an issue with Minecraft Bedrock, as it does not let you host and play on the same system without running a command, if you use this feature we would love your feedback on weather this patch works as we are seeing mixed reviews so far.

While that's all we have for now!
Thanks for reading.
